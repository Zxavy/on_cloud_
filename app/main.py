Welcome to AutoML! This application is designed to help you quickly build and evaluate regression models for time-series data, specifically focusing on memory usage. The application guides you through the process of loading your data, profiling it, preprocessing it, training models, and visualizing the results.

Time-series data is a type of data that is collected at regular time intervals. The primary components of time-series data include:
- Trend: The overall direction of the data over time (upward, downward, or stationary)
- Seasonality: Regular, predictable fluctuations in the data that occur over a specific time period (daily, weekly, yearly, etc.)
- Noise: Random variations in the data that are not part of the underlying trend or seasonality

Use the sidebar to navigate through the different steps of the application:
1. Load Data: Upload your time-series data file (CSV format)
2. Data Profiling: Explore your data and visualize its statistical properties
3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess your data for better model performance
4. Model Training: Train and tune regression models on your preprocessed data
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your trained models
6. Visualization: Visualize the predictions of your best-performing model
